/**
 * This class holds the environment for evaluating expressions that include
 * symbols.  For example, in the SQL command:
 * <pre>  SELECT a, b + 5 FROM t WHERE c < 20;</pre>
 * All of the expressions refer to columns in the current tuple being considered
 * from the table <tt>t</tt>, and thus need to be able to access the current
 * tuple.  This is the role that the environment class serves.
 * <p>
 * An important detail about the environment is that a single tuple's schema can
 * hold values from multiple tables, such as when a tuple is produced as the
 * result of a join operation between two tables.
 *
 * @design (donnie) This class could be applied in several different ways.
 *         Any SELECT clause really could (or should) have its own environment
 *         associated with it, because it will reference tables.  In addition,
 *         a derived table (a named subquery in the FROM clause) can also be
 *         referred to by name.  So, we will have to devise a strategy for
 *         managing environments properly.  Some plan-nodes will have to be
 *         responsible for updating environments, but definitely not all will do
 *         so.
 *         <p>
 *         It probably makes the most sense to give <em>every</em> plan-node its
 *         own environment-reference.  If the reference is null, the node could
 *         get its parent's environment.  Or, we could set all plan-nodes to
 *         have a specific environment, and just manage that assignment process
 *         carefully.
 *         <p>
 *         Environments can refer to a parent environment, for cases where a
 *         query contains subqueries.  The subqueries can refer to the same
 *         table(s) as the outer query, and thus they need their own environment
 *         to track that information.  This becomes especially useful with
 *         correlated subqueries, as the inner query needs to be completely
 *         reevaluated for each value of the outer query.
 *         <p>
 *         Matching a symbol name goes from child to parent.  If a child
 *         environment contains a value for a particular symbol, that value is
 *         returned.  It is only if the child environment <em>doesn't</em>
 *         contain a value that the parent environment is utilized.
